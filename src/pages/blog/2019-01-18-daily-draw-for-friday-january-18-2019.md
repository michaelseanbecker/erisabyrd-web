I'm still under the weather so for the third day I turned to Fool's Dog for my Card of the Day. I used the Wizard's Tarot by Corrine Kenner and John J. Blumen, a fantastic learning deck that I spoke about in loving detail on December 13, 2018. The card that showed was the Ace of Wands.



So far, we've covered the Ace of Swords, Ace of Cups and now the Ace of Wands; Air, Water, and Fire, respectfully. The Ace is a fancy way of saying "One," so the Ace of anything is the first of that element. The first number is masculine, sure, but also the beginning of any endeavor. Since fire signs,  Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius rule the day, you can bet you'll be dealing with the questions of "Who am ?", "What do I most want, and what makes me feel creative?" and "Where am I headed?". Aries deals with the self, Leo deals with creation and creativity, and Sagittarius loves to travel, be it mental or physical. To pull from Eastern Philosophy, Fire represents the southern direction, joy, summer, laughter, the heart, small intestine, and bitter foods because one must eat bitter to taste sweet. 



Here's how I see the last few days. Two days ago we were drowning from water spilled from the Ace of Cups, but letting those emotions out probably nourished the seeds of the projects that were on our minds yesterday. Today we're furthering that creativity because Wood feeds Fire. We've set ourselves to succeed, and now we can use every bit of creativity that is offered to us today to move forward in our dreams. I chuckled a little today when I saw the Ace of Wands. I've mentioned before that I'm taking an Herbalist certification course and I'm still in the early days. We will learn Eastern and Western Herbalism, and I have enjoyed learning about all of the different philosophies. I Love Chinese 5 Element theory but the Western idea of the Four Humours is the closest to Astrology and Tarot, so it's been fun to play with both. Since I've had such a horrible wet cold, I looked to the opposite to help me. Usually, Water puts out hot and dry Fire (you may have noticed that when you see a Cancer and Leo together), so it's Fire that I need to nip this cold in the bud.



My message from the past few days' series of cards have been, "ok, you have a cold, but be patient because what you are doing to heal is working, but today zap it with some fire!". Other people could look at them more internally, "You may be overwhelmed with emotion right now, but it's ok, letting it out is healthy and doing so will set you on the right path to make way for creativity!" There are lots of ways to read the cards from the last few days. If anyone is interested, the Ace of Wands also represents sexual activity. Wowzah!



Regardless of how the cards are speaking to you, here are my parting thoughts: the past few days may have been a little overwhelming with emotion and the desire to achieve goals NOW, but today is about joy and love. Take time to love yourself, pick up that hobby that you have put aside too long, laugh with friends, craft with your children, plan a vacation, have some sexy time... do whatever you love to do that will help you connect to what truly makes you happy, and today will be a good day.



Until tomorrow...
