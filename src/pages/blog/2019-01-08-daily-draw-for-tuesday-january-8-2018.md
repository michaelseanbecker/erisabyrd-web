I took a winter break from writing for the last few weeks but I'm back at it now, and today's deck is one of my new favorites.



The Venetian Tarot by Eugene Viniski was originally posted on Kickstarter. I found the release of his mini deck and couldn't afford them at the time. It's pricey, but the card stock is sturdy with gilded edges, and the artwork is beautiful. I hemmed and hawed on it for a while, but I knew one day I wanted to get it. When I got a little holiday money, I decided that it was my chance. I do believe I have a link to Venice in a past life and when I saw the artwork for the first time, I felt a great sense of familiarity. I believe any level of reader could read these cards easily. The art is vibrant and bright, and though Eugene has used a little flexibility in the symbolism to work with the theme, it's still very much a Rider-Waite deck. The mini version that I purchased is also incredible for smaller hands. In some respects, I wish I had the larger deck so that I could "fall" into the art a bit more, but the sizing is perfect to carry in my purse on the regular. 



So what card did we get today with the Venetian Tarot? The 9 of Cups. No matter how you cut it, when the 9 of Cups shows up, you're going to have a good day. Actually, I can't say that. You could be having an absolutely horrid day with grumpy co-workers and stained clothing and bad traffic, but it won't faze you. The 9 of Cups is ruled by Jupiter in Pisces, or "I believe in the expansion of luck!" The world could be throwing major messes at you, but with the 9 of Cups, you will feel such satisfaction in where you are now in your emotions and beliefs that nothing else matters. 



The number 9 is the last big push before you reach the end. It makes you stop and think about how far you have come, and what you have done to get here. The 9 of Cups is the moment to appreciate the individual that you have become and to really decide where you want to go next emotionally. You are almost there! Sometimes this card will come up for parties and weddings and any gathering where you can share your good fortune with others, and if that happens congratulations! The only thing I can add here is, don't become smug about your rewards. You have so many cups which are so full of joy, share them with an open heart, expect nothing in return and enjoy making other people happy. 



Paired with the 9 of cups today is the Lenormand Tree. We've gotten the Tree before, but as a reminder, the Tree represents, growth, general health, family and the world tree. I'm a tree hugger, so I understand why such a lovely card is paired with such a lovely symbol that I love so dearly. 



Appreciate your blessings today. Thank your good health, and your beautiful family that was either formed by blood or by choice. Share your fortunes with the world. You have almost reached your emotional goals. Meditate on how far you have come and feel excited about the next step. I'm excited for you!



Have a great day everyone!
