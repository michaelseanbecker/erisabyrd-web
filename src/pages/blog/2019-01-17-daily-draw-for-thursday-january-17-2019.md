If, while looking at this post you have the feeling of deja vu, there is a reason for that. On December 9, 2018 I used Fool’s Dog, Everyday Witch Tarot app and this exact card, the 7 of Pentacles, came up. I'd like to note that the 7 of Pentacles as come up more than any other card so far. Please do go back and read my post from December 9th, but for today, I will say this: keep at it guys. We’re half way through the first month of the calendar year. I think this is the time that people start losing interest and motivation with their new year’s resolutions. The 7 of Pentacles is saying that the work is paying off, be patient, don't rush. In the meantime enjoy the process. As for me, I'm going to go back to bed and nurse the cold in my head. I think it will be a short one. I've done everything I can and now I wait for the pay off. 

Until tomorrow!
