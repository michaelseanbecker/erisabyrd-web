"To be what we are, and to become what we are capable of becoming, is the only end of life."

\-Robert Louis Stevenson



Right before I used my pendulum to decide on today's deck for Card of the Day, I was considering my options for a movie. It's Friday, why not take advantage of AMC A-List?  There are a lot of options, but the front-runner is a new film that stars Willem Dafoe as one of my favorite artists, Vincent Van Gogh, in the last two years of his life. Pulling the Art of Life (discussed on November 27th) makes me think I need to see the Van Gogh film. 



How can I tie this all into the Card of the Day? The Three of Wands is ruled by the Sun in Aries, "I am truly myself and my energy is strong." Guess who was an Aries? Mr. Van Gogh. This card represents the assertive directness of Aries who sees what he wants and acts on it. Every Aries I know seeks out a challenge and has the uncanny ability to make everything about themselves. This is not a terrible thing. All but one of my very close friends out here is an Aries. I love them. I gravitate to them. How can you not? They make things happen, and they will always have your corner because you become "theirs," and they take care of "theirs." Yes, Aries can be difficult sometimes, but like a toddler, an Aries is only trying to exert themselves as they discover who they are. Eventually, they'll learn to play nice with others.



Vincent had a vision that no one else could understand and with his Aries energy he was challenging at times, but it was the fire in him that made him one of the most creative artists ever known. This creativity is further reflected in the "three" in the 3 of Wands. The number three represents creativity and community, and Vincent's community was made up of the local post-impressionists that saw him as he was, a  brilliant artist. It was only the ordinary people that saw him as strange, and this made survival difficult. It often takes monetary support to be creative in business, and without it, all of these artists were on similar journeys (ruled by the Lenormand Boat), of the starving artist. Despite the difficulties, Vincent and our artists persevered, and that is genuinely what the 3 of Wands represents. It's not being sure that you will succeed but doing it anyway. It's having a vision and taking yourself on the journey to help others see things the way you do. It's creating to share who you really are. 



So, that is your task today. With Aries energy supporting you, find your people, share your creative vision, and bravely move forward to make it a reality. The Boat will carry you on your way to make it happen and the word of one of my favorite Aries, "BOOM!"



  Have a great day!
