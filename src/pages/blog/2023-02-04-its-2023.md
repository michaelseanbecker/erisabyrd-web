Hi there!

It's been a while since I posted, but I'm still here! I took a child to college and started another in high school. I've lost a beloved pet and added a new one to our family. I've closed up shop at one location and have found the flexibility in primarily working at home. I'm still meeting people in person, over face time, and through texts, and you can occasionally find me at events and fairs. If you have any burning questions or want to learn something new, I'm happy to be your guide. 

Have a great day!
