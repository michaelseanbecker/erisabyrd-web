Look at my sexy new decks guys! I’ve said before, but I love combining Le Petit Lenormand and Tarot in my readings and I was treated to some early holiday cheer with these decks. The card on the left is from the Kickstarter funded Dreamkeeper’s Tarot by Liz Huston. I attended her art show where she showcased all 78 original tarot paintings and I was blown away. This deck was a passion project of hers for the last 10 years and finally with the help of kickstarter she was able to make it a reality. The images are beautifully surreal based on antique photographs and elevated to art that strikes your subconscious in delicate ways. At least that’s how it is for me. This is my very first time using this deck so I can’t really describe more but so far I’m really happy to have it in my hands.

The card on the right is from one of my newest Lenormand decks and it’s called Natalie Rose Winter Solstice Lenormand, released by Etsy store Tarot By Seven. The images for this deck were created by mother and daughter and bring a little bit of winter wonderland to a reading. Here’s what I wrote on Etsy:

“I received these lovely cards last night and played with them right away. They shuffle amazingly well and the bridge size that I ordered fits perfectly in my small hands. I love having the choice of optional cards for the tree, children and men and women. Overall, its a very pretty deck and really puts you into the holiday spirit! I know my clients are going to love them.”

So there you go! I also received Tarot By Seven’s Samhain Vintage Lenormand. I look forward to working with them as well!

In edition to using my sexy new decks today, I was compelled to also pull a crystal to use along with my Selenite and my Labradorite that I use for every reading. I believe Selenite and Labradorite to be two of my favorite stones. I wear a Selenite pendulum every day for positive protection, and I’ve always loved the feldspar qualities of Labradorite. Looking into a labradorite crystal is like peering into a hidden magical forest. Using the two together in my readings offers me a deeper connection to my intuition and the astral plane and protection as I wander there. Am I “going under” when I read? No, but laying my stones out connects me to my ability to listen and still maintain a connection to reality to communicate clearly to my clients, and I’m grateful that I can. Now, the crystal that I pulled from my bag of tricks, today, was amethyst. Oh what a lovely stone. Amethyst helps with sleep, connects you to you higher consciousness and Crown Chakra and is a fantastic healer for the emotions and spirit. It cleanses, protects, and opens. Looks like I REALLY need help connecting. I think I understand why…

Card of the day: 7 of Cups. Let me say first that my intention when I’ve pulled these cards is to pull one that will help and speak to the most people. I want a card that has it’s pulse on the the conscious and sub-conscious of everyone. I’m included in those everyones. The 7 of Cups is ruled by Venus in Scorpio “I desire love and art. ALL the beautiful things.” We’ve had a lot of Scorpion energy the last few days. Our Sun has only JUST left the sign of Scorpio on Thursday and is now making it’s way through Sagittarius. I believe that means we still have some unfinished emotional digging to do, and the 7 of Cups is further accentuating this fact. Yesterday, the Scorpio energy was really heavy. Emotionally we felt as if we were sinking, but the ruling planet was Mars. Mars is about action. He wanted us to look our sadness in the face and say, “I acknowledge you, but now I will do something about it. I will dig deep and figure out what is truly effecting me and then go from there.” Today’s Scorpio is much more comfortable as it is ruled by Venus and all the things that make us feel good. When Scorpio desires something he will stop at nothing to get it because his classic ruler is Mars. So, what you have here today, is a card that shows up because there’s a LOT of options out there. Look how many faces our card’s heroine has!  

You know, I just realized that today is the day after Black Friday: Small Business Saturday. Oh man, SOOOO many options. Too many. Too many choices. My email this morning had 156 message. 156! And almost all of them were coupons for stores. Emotionally, we’re all overwhelmed. The 7 of Cups is a card to pull when you wish you had more choices, but it can wreak havoc on your psyche if you have a difficult time making decisions. The Clover showed up as support to say, “yes, this is about money, but also luck. How lucky you are that you are in the position to be able to choose.” She’s right you know. So listen to Amethyst and follow your intuition, listen to clover and enjoy the positive influence she may have, and listen to the 7 of Cups and think “there are worse things than trying to figure out how to spend my money”, and if money has been hard this year as it has been for a lot of people, things are looking up!

Make good choices guys, but make them.
