Today, I am using the Beautiful Rebellion Tarot by Robin L. Cole (discussed on November 22nd). Perhaps I'm feeling a little rebellious today. I have a lot to do, some of which is negotiating with the hierarchy, which is ruled by the Hierophant. I think he's following me.

So, guess who showed up again? No, not the Hierophant; the 10 of Wands! Out of 78 cards and sixteen days of readings, the 10 of Wands has made an appearance three times: today, November 2st and December 3rd.  The Daily Draw is never about me, though it does include me. I've mentioned it before, but I always ask my guides to show me a card that can benefit the most people the most clearly. Apparently, I'm not the only one that has a lot going on. 



As a recap, the 10 of Wands is ruled by Saturn in Sagittarius. "I aim for structure and responsibility." Well, Saturn has given us a lot of responsibility, but if you notice, our heroine in the Beautiful Rebellion is weary but resolute, still bent with the weight but resolved that this burden is hers alone and she will see it to completion. While the  December 3rd, 10 of Wands message was "be willing to accept assistance if someone offers help but be careful of attached strings," today, the message seems to be,  "this load is yours. You accepted it, and now you must see it through to completion, on your own." The real message I think should be "you took all of this on. If you don't like it, learn how to say "no."



So what is this burden all about really? Lenormand's card of the day is The Book. Books hide hidden knowledge. Sometimes they represent education (like Sagitarrius) or business deals (like Capricorn, ruled by Saturn) but most of the time they represent a secret or unknown information. Our burdens could be emotional or mental from carrying a secret that's weighing on our heart. Our burdens could be coursework from school lesson that seems overwhelming. Our burdens can be from taking on too much to make that business deal finally go through. Here's what I can say about all of that. Stop pushing. We're in a Mercury Retrograde, and it has a hand in ALL of those things. Things are difficult right now because we are such a Mercury-based society, but it will move Direct on Thursday so slowly all things in communication, education, and business will start to work more efficiently. Give it time. Your burdens are your own, but they'll be a lot easier to carry if you walk with the wind instead of against it. If your struggles and obstacles can't wait, find peace and think, "it will all be over soon."

 

Have a good day everybody.
