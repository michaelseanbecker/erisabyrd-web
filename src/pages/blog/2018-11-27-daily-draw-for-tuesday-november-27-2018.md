What a lovely day! Well, that's what the Card of the Day is telling me. I pulled the 3 of Cups with the Lenormand Bouquet. Yes!



Firstly, the deck that I'm using is one that caught my eye right away. I'm a lover of classic art. Along with vocal music, I studied 2-dimensional art at my performance art middle-school and when I was very young, every year of my keepsake book said "artist" under the, "what do you want to be when you grow up?", section. I feel that I've upheld my end of the bargain to my wee self. Everything that I've done in my life is on behalf of art and creativity. Little me just wasn't very specific. So, you can imagine my utter glee when I found the Art of Life Tarot curated by Charleen Livingstone. 



Charlene's story behind her deck is a sad one. It may feel very familiar to many. She describes in her Little White Book about the loss that she felt when her husband had Alzheimer's and how she turned to the card for solace. One night she dreamt of the Knight of Wands which spurred her into action to create a deck that everyone could use despite their knowledge of Tarot. Using her background in Art History and her love of quotes, this deck was born, and it is beautiful. When I was on a month-long cross-country road trip with my Mom, this was the deck that I brought. I knew that it would connect to her if she wanted a reading and I always find the cards inspiring. Pouring through the deck for the first time was like reconnecting to old friends and every quote chosen is poignant and often times one that I had not read previously. I'd probably carry the Art of Life around everywhere, I do carry the very well written LWB around, but as I said, it's oracle sized, so it takes up quite a bit of space in my bag. I suppose Charlene meant for this to be an "at home" deck or "next to the computer" deck. The box to house the cards is ingenious and allows you to slide your card of the day into the front so you can look to it for inspiration, (you can see the set-up in my picture) but it isn't very portable. When I do decide to bring the cards with me, like on my trip, I tuck them into a drawstring bag which is my preferred method of carry. I bring a LOT with me and I try to shed weight anyway that I can. 



Overall, this deck is beautiful and inspiring. Though it's not the first one that I turn to for professional readings, I still use it daily to help me set my intentions. Actually, there's one more place that would be good to set the Art of Life: on your nightstand to be the last thing you see before you go to sleep and the first to see when you wake up. That's MUCH better than a phone.



On to the reading...



The 3 of Cups is a lovely card ruled by Mercury in Cancer. Its phrase would be, "I feel communicative and I want to talk about my feelings." Who better to do that with than your two best friends? The number 3 is a creative, sociable number and when you see it you know that you will be aided by your community. I've always loved the number 3, it is a magic number after all. Thank you Schoolhouse Rock! When I pulled the 3 of Cups I audibly squealed "yay!", because when this card comes up, you know that you will have a nice day. You'll be surrounded by your best friends or the ones that know you best and you will all have a great time. Literally, this card will come up as "sisterhood" and it will often show up when I'm going to be one in a group of three women. That is my day today actually. I'll be at Slone Vintage, where I read on Tuesdays and it looks like it will be Amy, her employee Stephanie, and I, just having a good time. I've also had three women book appointments with me for later in the evening so the good times will just keep on. To further support the happy feelings I drew the Lenormand Bouquet. The Bouquet represents lovely gifts and all things beautiful. It will appear as women but also things related to women and lo and behold I'll be in a fashionable clothing store today.



So how can the 3 of Cups and Bouquet relate to you? Look to Sir J.M. Barrie's quote as a guide. He said, "Those who bring sunshine into the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves." Surround yourself with people that you love, much like those in "The Luncheon of the Boating Party" by Renoir. Explore the gifts that you have been given in your life and share them with others. Communicate your joyful feelings with all who are around you, and if you may be having a rough day, open yourself up to the happiness that others can bring to you if you let them. Find your tribe. They'll be there when you most need them.



Enjoy all the happiness that this day brings everyone!
