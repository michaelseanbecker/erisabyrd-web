Here we are at the end of the day, and I almost didn't pull a card to write about, but I now have a spotless kitchen, so it was well worth it.



Because it's so late, I decided to use another one of my Fool's Dog Tarot Apps (first discussed on December 3rd). Today I decided to use the Everyday Witch Tarot App. I love the deck so much I decided I needed it as an app as well so I'd always have it with me.



Today's card is the 7 of Pentacles, ruled by Saturn in Taurus. On December 1st, I drew the Vice Versa version of the 7 of Pentacles, and it was "That Side." If you recall the Vice Versa Tarot has no front or backs, only "This" and "That" side and each explores the opposites of the other. Let's call it like it is, it was the back, the opposite meaning of what the 7 of Pentacles would normally be. Today, however, I have drawn the front. 



So here's what I see for today. The 7 of Pentacles is still very much, "I have achievements." It's about planting seeds that will sprout and grow into something with which you can be proud.  Look at our girl here. She's pleased with her harvest. I certainly would be. She's growing wine grapes. She also seems to be good at it since she's sampling a glass, most likely from a previous year.  I've said it in other posts, Capricorn achieves great things because he uses everything in his resources to reach the goals that he creates for himself. Our girl has a book. She's probably well read in the history and techniques of winemaking. She knows that hard work truly pays off and she's right. To succeed, we must put in the work in whatever way we can. We must gather together our resources, and we will be profitable. 



I think it's a good sign that in only a week or so we got "this" side of the 7 of Pentacles. It shows that maybe we have stopped disparaging over the seeds that lie dormant and are planting the ones that bare fruit. Whatever you are working on now, don't give up, keep at it, success is around the corner. 



Until tomorrow!
