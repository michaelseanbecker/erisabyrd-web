You can find me at the Burbank High School Drama Fundraiser for their production of The Elephant Man on Saturday, April 8, from 4:30 pm-6:30 pm.

I will be offering two card readings for $10 to help you see your inner beauty and how you can use it to make the world a better place. Money earned will help spread the joy of reading AND the Burbank High School Drama Department!

The Fundraiser is open to the public; hope to see some familiar faces!
