First time I am back doing readings Slone Vintage in two years!

We are celebrating love this Saturday with Jillian’s Valentine’s Tea Party!

💖 I will be doing a special $10 “Kisses and Hugs” Tarot Readings to bring more love into your life, with a special gift for everyone that sits down.

💖 [@shop.littlechimes](https://instagram.com/shop.littlechimes) will have everything you need to adorn yourself or your garden.

💖 [@slonevintage](https://www.instagram.com/slonevintage/) will have fresh flowers in found vases, sweet treats, bubbles, and tea.

💖 Plus, all new vintage hitting the shop! Hope to see you there!
