The hits keep coming. Yesterday the Card of the Day was the Vice Versa version of the 7 of Pentacles. The Vice Versa 7 of Pentacles talked about how sometimes the projects that we are working on are not quite what we are expecting: that sometimes the harvest isn't as plentiful as it could be. Today, using the Everyday Tarot by Brigit Esselmont and Eleanor Grosch (discussed on November 28th), a similar theme has come up.  Let's say that you've done the work, you've given your time, energy, and resources, and your goal fails. You find yourself at square one and it feels as if you've hit rock bottom. That rock bottom is the 5 of Pentacles. Ruled by Mercury in Taurus it means, "What I own  is on my mind and I want to talk about it." A 5 is a rather unstable number, and, again, 5 is the number for the Hierophant. While 4 is stability and 6 represents balance and the middle of the journey, the 5 is a little off-center. It's a perfect number to represent humanity.  It's that insecurity that we feel that drives us to seek out religious leaders and guides to help us get through the difficult times. 



That's where the person in our story finds herself. The weather is dreadful and cold and she trudges through the snow as the wind whips around her cloaked form. She could continue on with her head bowed in her own frigid misery, or she could raise her head for a moment to see that there is help nearby. There is a stained glass window offering a view to the sanctuary which will no doubt offer her assistance is she asks for it. The Tree of Life in the window represents nurturing and health and the 5 shows that there is a teacher or someone in the building that can offer a hand. All she needs to do is to go in and ask. It's difficult to see past the storm and often times it feels easier to keep trudging on than to ask for help even if we truly need it. It can be embarrassing to admit that we have hit our lowest but if we feel we have utterly failed, there are usually people there that can help us pick up the pieces. In my family, we often tell our little inventor that failure is actually a success. It doesn't matter how many variations that you try, only that you tried them because each failure brings you closer to something that will work. He still gets frustrated when a project doesn't come to fruition and he has to begin again, but at least he knows that we are there for him to help him pick up the literal pieces, often in the shape of LEGOs. 



So that is the message today: not every project will be a success and you may feel alone but the Lenormand coffin is there to say, "Let it go. It's already dead and gone so you might as well let it go willingly." Seeing the coffin may really rub salt in the wound but remember, every death brings change. It may be hard to see it now, but maybe that project or business truly isn't your path. Change may be exactly what you need. If you find yourself affected by the 5 of Pentacles right now, if you are at the end of your rope financially, mentally and emotionally, if you have suffered a death of a business or even a loved one, reach out to your community no matter how embarrassing it may be. You will have help. You only have to ask. 



It will only move up from here guys. Have a good one.
